# Fixing Code

**Clean code** is code that is easy to read, understand and maintain. It makes software development predictable and 
increases the quality of a resulting product.

**Code smells** are indicators of problems that can be addressed during refactoring. 
Code smells are easy to spot and fix, but they may be just symptoms of a deeper problem with code.

**Refactoring** is a systematic process of improving code without creating new functionality that can transform a mess 
into clean code and simple design.
