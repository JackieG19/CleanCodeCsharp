**Long Methods**
- hard to understand, change and re-use

Should want methods that specialise in one thing

**Cohesion Principle**
- things that are related, should be togther
- things that are not, should NOT be togther

**Single Responsibility Principle**
- A class/method should do only one thing and do it very well
